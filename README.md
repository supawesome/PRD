# Pseudo Random distribution

This repository contains a Python module called `prd.py` which implements functions for generating and analyzing pseudo-random distributions.
  
`PRD-Analysis.ipynb` is a Jupyter notebook that explains the concept of Pseudo Random distribution and highlights its distinction from true randomness. The notebook includes an introduction to Pseudo Random distribution, a comparison between samples from Bernoulli distribution and Pseudo Random distributions, and an analysis of the resulting samples. The notebook also includes a histogram of both samples and a demonstration of the computation of the $C$ constants.  
The notebook uses the functions provided in `prd.py` to generate the samples and sequences used in the analysis.
